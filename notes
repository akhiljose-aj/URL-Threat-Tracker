>Malicious Keywords: It checks if the URL contains certain keywords
commonly associated with malicious websites such as "malware," "phishing," "attack," "exploit," or "virus."

>IP Address Check: It checks if the URL starts with an IP address
(in the format of "http://x.x.x.x" or "https://x.x.x.x").
This is often used by malicious websites to obfuscate their identity.

>Excessive Subdomains: It checks if the URL has an excessive number of subdomains
 (more than or equal to 4 dots in the domain part). Some malicious websites use long subdomains to deceive users.

>Known Suspicious Domains: It checks if the URL's domain (netloc) is part of a list of known suspicious domains.
 These are typically free hosting domains or domains associated with a higher risk of malicious activity.

>Unusual Characters: It checks if the URL contains characters that are
not letters, digits, spaces, colons, periods, or hyphens. Unusual characters can be
 an indicator of a malicious URL.

>URL Shorteners: It checks if the URL matches common URL shortener patterns
(e.g., bit.ly, t.co, tinyurl.com). Malicious actors may use URL shorteners to hide
 the actual destination of the link.

>The script takes user input for a URL and then applies these checks.
 If any of the checks pass (i.e., return True),
  it considers the URL potentially malicious and prints a corresponding message.
   Otherwise, it assumes the URL is not malicious.

>It's important to note that this script provides a basic level of URL analysis and
should not be considered foolproof.
Malicious websites can employ various techniques to evade detection,
 so additional security measures should be implemented in a real-world application.
 Also, the list of known suspicious domains may need to be updated over time as new threats emerge
